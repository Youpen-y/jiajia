1) Read the docs!

2) This is still an early release, so please be prepared for configuration
   problems and/or bugs.  

3) Please send any source changes/new protocols that you think might be of
   general use to me so that I can fold them back into the next distribution.

Please let me know if this does not work for anyone, and what *does* work
for you if this does not. 

Before running any programs, set up your .jiahosts file at the directory of
your applications.  starting with the host that you start on.
